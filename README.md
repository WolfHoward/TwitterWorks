# First Experiences with the Twitter API

I'll be adding scripts and functions as I find new use cases. At the moment I'm interested in building lists of users that are talking about certain topics so I can reach out to them personally about my startup's cause.

In that interest, my first script allows me to define a hash tag search term and collect the most popular tweets in the last 7 days, then collect the screen names of each and add them to a private list I set up on Twitter.

A good next step would be creating the list through the API. Also I'm running into an issue where I only get 15 results no matter how many I ask for in my API query, which I believe is an issue with the twitter-python package. More on that as I learn about it.
